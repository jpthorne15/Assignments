              Our task was to optimize the flyout menu of the Webpage of 1280 the Zone 
              The team reviewed the current work done on the CSS and HTML files and added appropriate adjustments to change the responsiveness of the menu.
              My role was mostly to research options to make the responsiveness on the mobile as good as on the desktop application.
