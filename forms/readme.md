What types of tags can you use to create forms? 
Headers <h1> <h2>
Head tag <head>
Body tag <body>
Form <form>
Unordered list <ul>
Break <br>
 
What are the benefits/disadvantages of using some tags over others? 
The two I can think of are the Textarea <textarea> versus the paragraph <p> tag
Textarea defines multiline input control
Defined in rows and columns and can be controlled by css input parameters
The paragraph tag supports event attributes and can be justified left right center etc. 
My thoughts are that the textarea has the advantage of better integrating with css because it can be contolled by css parameters.
